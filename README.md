#Nitpicker

#What it is

Nitpicker is a simple tool that lets you visualize a webpage in multiple browsers, and then compare them.

#Requirements

Nitpicker run its browsers in docker, so docker is a must-have.
If running inside of a container, there is no other requirement.

If not, you need to install python3-PILL, python3-Docker, and python3-Selenium.
